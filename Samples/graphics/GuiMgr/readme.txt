GuiMgr Sample

This sample demonstrates a simple graphics user interface ( a stripped down and modified version from NOLF2).
It supports wchar true type fonts and multiple resource files for different languages.

To run the English version execute run.bat.
To run the Chinese version execute runCh.bat

Older versions of windows may need to have unicode true type font support installed.
