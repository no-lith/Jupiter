mpflycam sample.

This game tutorial is very similar to the SampleBase sample with the 
exception that mpflycam has been expanded to support multi-player
server-based play. In addition, instead of a simple camera the
player is seeing through the eyes of a pigeon, with the size, 
physics, and flight controls normally associated with pigeons. 
If other players enter the game, they are visible as other pigeons. 
Interactivity between players is extremely limited.

When the tutorial begins, you need to bring down the console by 
pressing the ~ (tilde) key. Then you should type normal, server, or 
join and hit enter.

  Typing normal creates a regular, single-player game.
  Typing server creates a multiplayer server that other clients 
  can attach to.
  Type join <IP address> (where <IP address> is the IP of a 
  computer that is running the sample in server mode) to join a 
  server game. The IP should be in the form 127.0.0.1.

Detailed documentation on the C++ code for this project may be
found in the tutorial section of Docs\JupiterHelp.chm
