Animations2

This tutorial extends Animations by adding the ability to play complex model animations.

When the tutorial begins, you need to bring down the console by 
pressing the ~ (tilde) key. Then you should type normal, server, or 
join and hit enter.

  Typing normal creates a regular, single-player game.
  Typing server creates a multiplayer server that other clients 
  can attach to.
  Type join <IP address> (where <IP address> is the IP of a 
  computer that is running the sample in server mode) to join a 
  server game. The IP should be in the form 127.0.0.1.

Detailed documentation on the C++ code for this project may be
found in the tutorial section of Docs\JupiterHelp.chm
